# Elementary Music Synthesis
This project investigated one possible method in which music can be synthesized. After the music had been synthesized, various ways of improving the sound quality were investigated, which involved creating an ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope and overlapping the musical notes.

I would like to give credit to UW Bothell professor Dr. Tadesse Ghirmai for providing the specifications for this project.

# Background
Each musical note is a sinusoidal signal with its frequency depending on the pitch of the note.

In the case of this project, I only dealt with the octave of 220 Hz to 440 Hz, as shown in the table below.
