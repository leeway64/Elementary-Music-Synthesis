# Elementary-Music-Synthesis
This project investigated one possible method in which music can be synthesized. After the music had been synthesized, various ways of improving the sound quality were investigated, which involved creating an ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope and overlapping the musical notes.

I would like to give credit to UW Bothell professor Dr. Tadesse Ghirmai for providing the specifications for this project.
